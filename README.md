# wowclaude

**Install once, get better Claude Code responses forever.**

A Claude Code plugin that uses multi-layered hooks to inject evidence-based quality principles. No configuration needed.

## TL;DR

Claude Code makes stuff up when asked about internals (bit flags, private APIs, etc.). This plugin detects those risky queries and forces Claude to mark uncertain details with "iirc" instead of presenting them as fact. It also reminds Claude to read files before editing them. Three hooks, zero config, ~150 words of prompt injection total.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add jbj338033/wowclaude
/plugin install wowclaude
```

## The 5 Principles

| # | Principle | What it does |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **certainty** | Prevents confabulation on high-risk topics. Forces "iirc" markers on unverified internal details. |
| 2 | **investigation** | Forces reading before writing. Verify with tools, or say you can't. |
| 3 | **reasoning** | Step-back reasoning on hard problems. Understand why, then solve. |
| 4 | **precision** | Matches effort to complexity. Less with qualifiers > more with false confidence. |
| 5 | **verification** | Self-checks against the original request before finalizing. |

### Hook Details

| Hook | Event | Trigger | Injection |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| **session-start.sh** | `SessionStart` | Every session | 5 quality principles (~90 words) |
| **user-prompt.sh** | `UserPromptSubmit` | Each message | CRITICAL: internal details (~60 words) / CAUTION: version-specific (~40 words) / none |
| **pre-tool-use.sh** | `PreToolUse` | Before Edit/Write | Investigation reminder (~20 words) |

### Multi-Tier Risk Detection

The `UserPromptSubmit` hook classifies queries into risk tiers:

**CRITICAL** — Internal implementation details (highest confabulation risk):
- Bit flags, enum values, struct fields, bytecode formats
- Private/undocumented APIs, compiler internals
- Runtime flags, syscall tables, fiber internals

**CAUTION** — Version-specific or platform-specific behavior:
- Breaking changes, deprecated features, migration paths
- Version-boundary behavior, platform differences

**Safe** — No intervention needed for general queries.

## Test Results

Tested with identical prompts before and after plugin installation:

| Test | Without wowclaude | With wowclaude |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| "List React fiber flags with bit values" | Lists specific hex values as fact | Prefixes values with "iirc", points to source file |
| "What's `process._linkedBinding('http_parser')` signature?" | Lists full API surface confidently | States values are unverified, recommends source check |
| "What is git stash?" | Concise answer | Concise answer (no unnecessary intervention) |

## What's NOT Included (and Why)

- **Expert persona** ("You are a senior engineer...") — No measurable accuracy improvement. Just makes responses longer.
- **"Think step by step"** — Modern Claude models already do chain-of-thought internally. Redundant instruction.
- **Magic phrases** ("Take a deep breath", "This is important for my career") — No generalizable effect.
- **Forced long reasoning chains** — Shorter, focused chains often outperform verbose ones.
